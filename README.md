data_view_interface
===================

A simple JavaScript tool to make requesting, displaying, caching, and changing Backend data easier for web apps.

Broken into 3 parts:
1. Data (holds backend data--eventually I want this to use browser storage when the capability exists)
2. View (holds a function to update the UI using a Data object)
3. Interface (completely optional, but may connect a user input event to a command to change or update a Data object)

Data
====
Used to create the data holding objects:
	 Constructor:
	 *   new Data(set_func, args)
	     where "set_func" is the backend communication function, and "args"
	     are any necessary arguments for the set_func function.
	     Note: "set_func" could be any function to set the data.
	 Interface:
	 * 	 Data.data = gives direct access to the data object or array
	 *   Data.get(callback) = returns callback with stored data or data retreived from backend
	 *   Data.update(callback) = force updates data stored in object or array. Offers callback
	 *   Data.change(set_fun, args) = a method to change the Data object set function and arguments
	 *   Data.current = a property used to check status of data 'yes', 'no', 'pending'
	 *   Data.addView(name, updateView) = a method to attach function to update a view when data loads
	 *   Data.hasView(name) = checks if view is attached by name
	 *   Data.removeView(name) = removes an attached view by name
	 *   Data.clearViews = removes all attached views

View
====
Used to create objects to update UI
	 Constructor:
	 *   new View(name, update, Data)
	     where "name" is the name of the View, update is a function that updates the view,
	     and Data is an optional Data object to attach (see data.js)
	 Interface:
	 *   View.attach(Data) = attaches a Data Object to the View
	 *   View.detach() = detaches the currently attached Data object, if any
	     Note: there is no protection against attaching more than one Data object :(
	 *   View.load(data, callback) = runs the update function with the optional data argument,
	     or the updated Data object attached. "callback" called after view udpate function (optional)
	 *   View.reload(callback) = just like load, but no option to input data manually.
	  	 "callback" called after view udpate function (optional)

Interface
=========
Used to easily link Data updates to form inputs
	 Constructor:
	 *   new Interface(input, format_func, Data)
	     where "input" is a reference to the input element interface, and 
	     "format_func" is optional and may be used to process the raw value
	     of the input element.
	 Interface:
	 *   Interface.attach(Data, format_func) = attaches a Data object to change in the
	     event of this.input value change. format_func may modify input value.
	 *   Interface.detach(Data) = detaches the Data object.
